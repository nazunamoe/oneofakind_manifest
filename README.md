Manifest for OneOfaKind
====================
OneOfaKind is a lightweight Chroma-AOSP ROM focused on battery, performance and stability.

The philosophy of OneOfaKind is to stay relatively close to Google's stock Lollipop with the additions of essential features that should have been included with stock Lollipop.
